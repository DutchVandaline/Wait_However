<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- Ïù¥ÎØ∏ÏßÄ ÏÇΩÏûÖ ![Pequod](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf45ee3-1001-459a-8db2-f32632e20dfc)-->
üî≠ ‚ÄúPropaganda can be achieved with just one sentence, but refutation requires an enormous amount of evidence.‚Äù This phrase, often attributed to Paul Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Germany Minister of Propaganda and Enlightenment and a so-called "master of propaganda," ironically, was never actually spoken by him. This sentence itself serves as an excellent example of the dangers of propaganda and the importance of verifying sources. The public tends to trust statements attributed to individuals recognized as authorities in a particular field without questioning their authenticity. This tendency creates an environment where false information can easily spread.<br/>

üöÄ **Wait, However** is designed to help users develop a balanced perspective by providing articles with diverse viewpoints. By presenting perspectives that contrast with the tone of a specific article, as well as offering a variety of opinions, the platform enables users to understand events from multiple angles. This approach prevents bias caused by fake news circulating abroad and supports the development of critical thinking among the public. Additionally, the platform incorporates an image verification system to evaluate reliability, filtering out false or low-credibility information. As a result, users are exposed to high-quality information, empowering them to make objective judgments.
